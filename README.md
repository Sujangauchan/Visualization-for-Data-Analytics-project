# WHO Mortality Database Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis related to the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database.

## Overview

The WHO Mortality Database provides cause-of-death statistics reported annually by member states. This data is invaluable for understanding global health trends, monitoring the burden of diseases, and informing public health policies.

This project analyzes cause-of-death statistics to understand global health trends. Key analysis steps include:

* **Data Loading and Merging:** Combining multiple data files and merging with country codes and population data.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Mapping countries to continents, aggregating data, and calculating mortality rates.
* **Data Visualizations:** Create 10 Data Visualization for clear insights.
* **Polynomial regression:** Polynomial regression modeling to map mortality rate based on age.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Forecasting mortality rates using LSTM and Arima models.
* **Clustering:** Grouping regions with similar mortality patterns using K-Means clustering.
* **Spark Analysis:** Performing big data data analysis and processing for scalability using pyspark.

**Access the Data:** Visit the [WHO Mortality Database](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/who-mortality-database) website and follow their instructions to access and download the specific data of interest.
